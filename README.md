Isnâ€™t it annoying using the command line to execute Database Queries?
If mistakenly closed the command line all queries are to be re-typed.!!!
Copy Paste is also an annoying task on command line when you have to control by keyboard.
Also, Using SQL Server Manager for executing simple queries consumes high memory.
When it comes to developers, Using SQL Server Manager can lag the system, as the already use heavy IDEs and studio which already consumes heavy RAM and resources.
Developer basically use CRUID Queries for an development ( C reate , R ead , U pdate , I nsert , D elete)
